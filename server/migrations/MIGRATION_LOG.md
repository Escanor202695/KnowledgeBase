# Database Migration Log

## 2025-10-30: Fix YouTube Duration Values

**Migration Script**: `fix-youtube-durations.js`

**Problem**: 
- youtubei.js API returns duration in milliseconds
- Code was treating values as seconds
- Result: Durations displayed as "3940:00:03" instead of "3:56:24"

**Solution**:
- Backend: Convert API duration from ms to seconds (server/routes.ts line 96-98)
- Database: Divide existing duration values by 1000 for videos where duration > 86400 seconds

**Execution Date**: October 30, 2025, 11:00 AM

**Execution Results**:
```
Connected to MongoDB

Found 0 YouTube sources
(No YouTube sources in sources collection yet - all videos are in legacy collection)

Found 2 videos (legacy)
  Fixing: Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up (Official Video) (4K Remaster)
    Old duration: 2079204 (579 hours)
    New duration: 2079 seconds (34 minutes)
  
  Fixing: If You're in Your 20s or 30s, Here's How to Win (at Anything)
    Old duration: 14184003 (3940 hours)
    New duration: 14184 seconds (236 minutes)

Done! Fixed 2 video(s)
```

**Verification**:
- End-to-end tests confirmed correct duration display:
  - Rick Astley video: "34:39" ✓
  - "If You're in Your 20s" video: "3:56:24" ✓
- No malformed durations (like "3940:00:03") found ✓

**Status**: ✅ Successfully completed

**Future Imports**: All new YouTube video imports will automatically use correct duration values due to backend fix.

## Migration Checklist

### Pre-Migration
- [x] Backup database (automatic via MongoDB Atlas)
- [x] Test migration script on development database
- [x] Verify backend code fix is in place

### Execution
- [x] Run migration script: `node server/migrations/fix-youtube-durations.js`
- [x] Verify output shows correct number of fixed records
- [x] Check sample records in database

### Post-Migration
- [x] Run end-to-end tests to verify UI displays correct durations
- [x] Verify no regression in existing functionality
- [x] Document results in MIGRATION_LOG.md
- [x] Update replit.md with changes

### Deployment Notes
- This is a **one-time migration**
- Only needs to be run if:
  - Restoring from pre-fix backup
  - Migrating data from another instance
  - Duration values appear malformed (>86400 seconds for normal videos)
